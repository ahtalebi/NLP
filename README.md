# NLP Projects and Predictions Repository

Welcome to our NLP repository! Here, we showcase various projects and predictions based on Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Dataset
For our NLP project, we utilized data from the [project_NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/code/martinkk5575/language-detection/input) dataset. It comprises 22,000 rows with two columns: "Text" and corresponding "Language". Notably, the dataset exhibits balanced distribution across various languages.

## Preprocessing
We focused on a selection of languages, including Indonesian, English, Dutch, Spanish, French, Chinese, Arabic, Portuguese, Turkish, Romanian, Swedish, and Russian. Leveraging NLTK, we obtained stopwords for these languages. After conducting statistical analyses, we performed Lemmatization and Stemming. Subsequently, to optimize computational efficiency, we worked with a 20% subset of data for each language.

## Models and Performance
Our analysis involved employing Linear Regression, achieving an accuracy of 85%, and Multinomial Naive Bayes, yielding 95% accuracy. Additionally, we narrowed our focus to English texts and conducted sentence (paragraph) classification.
